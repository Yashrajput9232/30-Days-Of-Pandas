Day 8 of 30 Days of Pandas: Find Users With Valid E-Mails: #1517

📝 Problem Description: We are given a table Users that contains information about users, including their user_id, name, and mail. Some e-mails are invalid. We need to find users who have valid emails based on the following conditions:

- The prefix name starts with a letter and may contain letters, digits, underscores, periods, and dashes.

- The domain should be @leetcode.com.

📊 Approach Using Pandas:

1. Regular Expressions in Python: We used the re.match function to validate emails based on the given constraints. The regular expression ensures the prefix starts with a letter and only contains valid characters.

2. Efficient Filtering: We applied the regex to the mail column and filtered out users with invalid emails, ensuring that only valid emails are returned.

📊 Approach Using SQL:

1. Regular Expressions in SQL: We used the "~" function to filter valid emails, ensuring the prefix starts with a letter and contains only valid characters, followed by the correct domain.
