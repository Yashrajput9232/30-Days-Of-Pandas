Day 18 of 30 Days Of Pandas: Find First Login Date for Each Player: #511

📝 Problem Description:

We are given a table Activity with the following columns:

- player_id: The ID of the player
- device_id: The ID of the device used by the player
- event_date: The date the player logged in and played games
- games_played: The number of games played by the player during the session

We need to find the first login date for each player.

📊 Approach Using Pandas:

1. Group by player_id: This allows us to get all the activity records for each player.
   
2. Find the minimum event_date: For each group (player), calculate the first login date by identifying the earliest date using .min() on the event_date column.

📊 Approach Using SQL:

1. SELECT: We select the player_id and the minimum event_date, renaming it as first_login.

2. GROUP BY: The results are grouped by player_id, so we can get the first login date for each player.
