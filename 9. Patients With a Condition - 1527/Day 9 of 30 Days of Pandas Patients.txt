Day 9 of 30 Days of Pandas: Patients With a Condition: #1527

📝 Problem Description: We are given a table Patients containing the patient ID, name, and their medical conditions. Each patient's conditions are represented as space-separated codes. Our task is to identify patients who have Type I Diabetes, where the condition code always starts with the DIAB1 prefix.

The goal is to return the patient_id, patient_name, and conditions of the patients who have Type I Diabetes.

📊 Approach Using Pandas:

1. String Matching with Regular Expressions: Pandas' str.contains() function allows for advanced string filtering using regular expressions. We used the \b word boundary to ensure the correct identification of the DIAB1 prefix.

2. Efficient Data Selection: Filtering based on specific patterns in a text column is a powerful feature of Pandas, allowing you to extract relevant data from large datasets efficiently.

📊 Approach Using SQL:

1. Regular Expressions in SQL: We used the "~" function to filter valid emails, ensuring the prefix starts with a letter and contains only valid characters, followed by the correct domain.
