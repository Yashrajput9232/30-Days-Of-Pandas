Day 13 of 30 Days Of Pandas: Rank Scores #178

📝 Problem Description:

We are given a table Scores with the columns id and score. The goal is to rank the scores in descending order according to these rules:

1. Scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.

2. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same rank.

3. The next rank should be the next consecutive integer value (no holes between ranks).📊 Approach Using Pandas:

📊 Approach Using Pandas:

1. First, we sort the scores in descending order using sort_values().

2. The rank() function is used with the method='dense' option to rank scores while keeping consecutive ranks even when there are ties.

3. The result contains the scores and their ranks, as required.

📊 Approach Using SQL:

1. The DENSE_RANK() function assigns ranks starting from the highest score, without skipping any ranks when there is a tie.

2. The ORDER BY clause ensures the result is ordered by score in descending order, as required.
