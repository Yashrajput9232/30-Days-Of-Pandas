Day 17 of 30 Days Of Pandas: Find Total Time Spent by Each Employee: #1741

📝 Problem Description:

We are given a table Employees with the following columns:

emp_id: Employee ID
event_day: The day the event occurred
in_time: The minute the employee entered the office
out_time: The minute the employee left the office

📊 Approach Using Pandas:

1. Group the data by emp_id and event_day.

2. For each group, calculate the time spent as out_time - in_time.

3. Sum up the time spent for each emp_id and event_day combination.

📊 Approach Using SQL:

1. SELECT: We select event_day (renaming it as day), emp_id, and the total time spent. The total time is calculated as the difference between out_time and in_time for each entry.

2. SUM: The total time for each employee on a given day is calculated by summing the difference between out_time and in_time.

3. GROUP BY: We group the results by event_day and emp_id so that the total time is calculated for each employee on each day.
