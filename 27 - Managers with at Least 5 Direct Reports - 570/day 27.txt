Day 27 of 30 Days of Pandas: Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports #570

📝 Problem Description:

Given an Employee table with columns id, name, department, and managerId, the task is to find managers who have at least five direct reports. For each qualifying manager, we need to return their name.


📊 Approach Using Pandas:

1. Filter the employees with a valid managerId to get only those who report to a manager.
2. Group by managerId and count the number of direct reports for each manager.
3. Filter the managers who have five or more direct reports and merge with the original table to get their names.


📊 Approach Using SQL:

1. Self-join the Employee table on managerId to count the direct reports of each manager.
2. Group by managerId and apply a filter to retain only managers with five or more direct reports.
3. Retrieve the names of these managers from the Employee table.
